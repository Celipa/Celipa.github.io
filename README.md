This is a HTML and CSS project for school where we were assigned to build a website for an Event organisation where customers can locate events, buy tickets and create their own event.
The Project is only HTML and CSS with the exception of JavaScript where i made a menu drop down on smaller devices.
This was built in Visual studio code.
