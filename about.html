                <h3>Linda scott</h3>
                <p>Linda Scott is the CEO and founder of EventFinder. She founded the company 20 years ago after trying to find an activity for her and her family. She was frustrated with how hard it was to find events in her city due to the lack of information about the events and when they were hosted. So she decidided to make a website that let her and her friends find events easier. She then realized that this was an issue for alot more people than herself, so she expanded her website to the entire neighbourhood, then the entire city, and after a few years her website was launched worldwide!</p>
